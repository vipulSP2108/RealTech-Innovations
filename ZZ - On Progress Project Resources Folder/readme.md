# On Progress Project Resources Folder

This folder contains resources, code, and incomplete projects that I am currently working on. It serves as a temporary storage space for ongoing work and allows for collaboration with team members or future reference.

## Contents
The folder may contain the following items:

1. Code Files: This folder includes code files written in various programming languages. These files are in progress and may not be fully functional or complete. They are meant for further development or experimentation.

2. Documentation: This folder contains any documentation related to the incomplete projects, such as design documents, specifications, or research papers. These documents provide insights into the project goals and help maintain a clear understanding of the project's objectives.

3. Resources: This folder holds additional resources required for the projects, such as images, datasets, or sample files. These resources assist in the development process and may be used for testing or implementation purposes.

4. Notes: This folder contains any personal notes, ideas, or brainstorming sessions related to the projects. These notes serve as a reference and can help provide context for future development or collaboration.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the projects and resources within this folder are incomplete and may not function as expected. Use them at your own risk and ensure appropriate backups are made. I am not liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of these files.
