# RealTech Innovations

Welcome to the RealTech Innovations folder! This repository contains a collection of innovative projects where we leverage technology to solve real-world problems. Each project is stored in its own folder, consisting of a code file, a report file and a readme file.
This document contains important information about this folder.

## Code

The `code` file contains the source code and implementation file for each project. You can explore the code and use it as a reference or as a starting point for your own implementations.

## Report

The `report` file for each project is a written report in the standard IEEE format. The report includes schematics, diagrams, supporting materials, instructions, user manuals, technical specifications, project objectives, methodology, and key findings. You are encouraged to read the report to enhance your comprehension of the project and gain a deeper understanding of the project.

## Readme

The `readme` file for each project gives an overview of each project and to witness the projects in action, we have included links to video demonstrations for each project. 

## Getting Started

To explore the projects and access the code, simply navigate to the respective project folders. Each project folder contains its own report file for detailed instructions.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and utilize these projects as inspiration for your own real-world problem-solving endeavors!
