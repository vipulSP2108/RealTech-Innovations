# SeismoSense

Our project, SeismoSense, introduces an innovative solution to safeguard objects from high amplitude free vibrations. By accurately measuring vibrations and providing timely alerts, we ensure object integrity and prevent potential damage. Watch our video to see SeismoSense in action and experience the future of object protection.

For a more interactive experience, we have created a video that showcases the project in action. You can watch the video by clicking [here]()."
