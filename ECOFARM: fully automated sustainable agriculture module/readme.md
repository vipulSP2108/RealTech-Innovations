# EcoFarm

Our project aims to automate water conservation and address the issue of unequal water distribution in agriculture. By utilizing sensors and technologies, we provide a convenient and efficient solution for watering plants and promoting sustainable water use.

For a more interactive experience, we have created a video that showcases the project in action. You can watch the video by clicking [here](insert_video_link)."
